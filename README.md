Key Features:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loads and preprocesses the Mall Customer Dataset, selecting relevant features (Annual Income and Spending Score) and standardizing the data for consistent scaling.
Hierarchical Clustering: Implements Agglomerative Clustering with the 'ward' linkage method to group similar customers together.
Dendrogram Analysis: Utilizes a dendrogram to visually represent the hierarchical clustering and gain insights into the optimal number of clusters.
Silhouette Score Evaluation: Evaluates the quality of clustering for different numbers of clusters using the Silhouette Score metric, aiding in the selection of the optimal cluster number.
Cluster Analysis: Analyzes the characteristics of each identified customer segment by calculating the mean values of features for each cluster.
Visualization: Visualizes the clusters in a 2D scatter plot, providing a clear visual representation of the customer segments in the feature space.
